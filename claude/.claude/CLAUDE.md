# Python
 - Whenever I ask you to create a Python "executable" handle the dependencies by heading the script file as follows
 ```python
 #!/usr/bin/env uv run --script
 # /// script
 # requires-python = <suitable-python-version>
 # dependencies = <list-of-dependecies>
 # ///
 ```
 where the `<text>` are placeholders. Afterwards, make sure you implement the required functionality in Python,
 make the file into an executable, and run the script.
